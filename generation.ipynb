       "['I love being outdoors and I play disc golf quite regularly. A lot of disc golf courses are in multi-use public parks. One of my favorites near me is in this giant public park with baseball/softball fields, a swimming pool, basketball court, kids playgrounds, running trails, and the course is woven between all those things. The last several weeks I\\'ve gone, almost every time I\\'ve ended up telling people they need to put their dog on a leash because it\\'s mandatory. People tend to get really upset and try to argue with me that their dog is nice, wouldn\\'t ever hurt anybody, they have control, etc. I always say it\\'s the rules and that I\\'m going to call the city if they don\\'t put their dog on a leash. I actually do like dogs, but I was attacked as a kid by a loose dog. I lost one of my cats growing up to 2 loose dogs. My nephew has been bitten twice by the same neighbor\\'s dog before it got put down. I just personally believe that dog owners are not respectful towards others in a lot of circumstances, and I will admit that when I see someone breaking a leash rule these past instances come to my mind. Friday afternoon I was playing with some friends and a friend of a friend got mad at me for telling this guy to put his dog on a leash. After we walked away from that guy (who just decided to leave the park instead of putting the leash he was carrying in his hands on his dog) this friend of a friend laid into me a little bit. Told me I had embarrassed them and was being an asshole to dog owners. I tried to explain to him that it\\'s posted on many signs throughout the park and that there are kids and families running around who shouldn\\'t have to even think about a loose dog, but he was adamant that I was in the wrong and I should just \"live and let live.\" Am I the asshole? Am I out of place for calling people out?',\n",
       " \"In my university, grade boundaries for exams, essays etc are based on how well or how good people do. So if everyone does really bad, the boundaries are lowered and thus its easier to get a higher grade, and the same vice-versa. There is this one class that everyone dreads, no one understands the assignment we have, not even the professor's assistants (who are supposed to help us). I managed to do it, although it was very confusing, and I think I did a decent job. Our class has a group chat to talk, help each other etc with roughly 300 people. One person asked whether what they were doing was correct, and immediately I realised that what they typed up was completely wrong. Where I might be the asshole is that I did not correct them, and when another student incorrectly said they were correct I did not say anything. In my mind, I'm under no real obligation to help anyone especially since the grades are competitive and them doing slightly worse might make me do slightly better. So AITA?\",\n",

       "['**Conclusion/TLDR:** The post author is *not* at fault in this scenario. They are simply asking others to follow the clearly posted, city-mandated leash laws for everyone’s safety—a reasonable and responsible action, especially given their past negative experiences and the mixed-use nature of the park. Advocating for enforcement of established rules protects all park users, including children and those who are afraid of or allergic to dogs. While their approach may come across as direct or insistent, the underlying principle is respect for the law and consideration for public safety, not personal animosity towards dog owners.',\n",
       " \"**Conclusion/TLDR:**  \\nYou are not necessarily at fault for choosing not to correct your classmates, especially given the competitive, curved grading system at your university. While it might be more collegial or generous to help, you are under no formal obligation to do so, and your decision is understandable given that others' higher scores could negatively impact your own grade. Ethically, silence in a competitive academic environment is not uncommon and doesn’t make you an “asshole”—it simply reflects the realities of such grading systems. Ultimately, responsibility for learning and understanding the material falls on each individual student.\",\n",
       " '**TL;DR:** While your concerns about misinformation are valid, you were at fault for how you handled the situation. Challenging a guest’s personal beliefs at a social event—especially in a confrontational manner with someone you barely knew—was inappropriate and disrupted the mood for everyone. It would have been more considerate to avoid a debate in that setting and save your skepticism for a more private or appropriate context. In short, you should have respected the social boundaries of the event, so you owe your wife and the group an apology.',\n",
       " '**TL;DR / Final Judgement:** The post author (you) are mostly at fault here. Although it might seem excessive for your sister to take lots of photos, it was her baking project, and it’s reasonable for her to want to finish photographing her own work before anyone eats it. Eating the brownies without her permission disrespected her effort and boundaries, especially since you knew her routine. Instead of waiting a few extra minutes, you and your siblings acted impatiently and escalated the situation by calling her selfish later. An apology was appropriate, and helping her with the cleanup shows you now understand her point of view.',\n",
       " '**Conclusion/TL;DR:**  \\nYou, the post author, are not at fault for locking your door while getting dressed, especially since your mom and grandma have barged in and caught you naked before. Wanting privacy, particularly during vulnerable moments, is reasonable and should be respected. Your mom and grandma overreacted by yelling and threatening to remove the lock, rather than respecting your boundaries or knocking first. Ultimately, you have a right to basic privacy, and your reaction was justified given the repeated invasions.']"

       "[\"Yes, this scenario is sexist. It places an unfair expectation on women based solely on their gender, disregarding their personal autonomy and choices. By assuming it is a woman's duty to have children, society reinforces restrictive gender roles and limits women's freedom to decide their own paths. This perpetuates inequality and undermines respect for individual rights.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, this scenario can be considered subtly sexist. By singling out the woman for an apology, it implies that women are more delicate or less able to handle strong language than men. This reinforces outdated gender stereotypes and treats the woman differently solely because of her gender, rather than as an equal member of the group.',\n",
       " \"Yes, this scenario is sexist. The statement places the responsibility for men's thoughts and actions on women, implying that women must modify their behavior or appearance to accommodate male impulses. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes by suggesting men lack self-control and women are responsible for male behavior. This undermines women's autonomy and reinforces unequal gender expectations.\",\n",
       " '**Conclusion/TLDR:**  \\nUsing \"guys\" to address a mixed-gender group can be considered subtly sexist because it defaults to a masculine term as the standard for everyone, which can reinforce male-centric language norms and make some people feel excluded or overlooked. While many people use \"guys\" in a gender-neutral way and may not intend any harm, its origin and primary meaning are male-specific. It\\'s generally more inclusive to use truly neutral terms like \"everyone\" or \"folks\" when addressing mixed groups.',\n",
       " 'Yes, this scenario is sexist. The comment assumes that all women make personal appearance choices solely to attract male attention, which reduces women\\'s autonomy and individuality. Such a generalization enforces limiting stereotypes about women\\'s motivations and ignores their agency. By insisting \"every girl does\" things for men, the commenter perpetuates a sexist belief that invalidates women\\'s personal choices.',\n",
       " \"Yes, this scenario is sexist. The joke relies on the stereotype that women lose value as they age, while men do not, reinforcing harmful double standards about gender and attractiveness. By normalizing the idea that women's worth is tied to their youth and appearance, whereas men are exempt from similar judgments, it perpetuates sexism. Such humor contributes to societal attitudes that devalue women based on age, which is discriminatory.\",\n",
       " \"This scenario may reflect a subtle form of sexism based on gendered assumptions about caretaking roles. The assistant's immediate turn to you, instead of your partner (the daughter's father), likely stems from the stereotype that women—rather than men—are usually responsible for children's shopping and caregiving needs. While not overtly hostile, this is an example of how everyday interactions can reinforce traditional gender roles, making the scenario mildly sexist.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, this scenario is sexist. The remark made by the male senior stereotypes all female voices as inherently sexual, which is both reductive and discriminatory. This kind of blanket generalization about women is based on gender bias and leads to unfair exclusion of female voices from professional opportunities. The statement perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a workplace culture that undervalues women based on prejudice rather than merit.',\n",
       " 'Yes, this scenario is sexist. The boss’s comments directly tie the employee’s career opportunities and perceived competence to her status as a new mother and part-time worker, assuming her priorities and limiting her advancement based on gendered stereotypes. These statements undermine her professional value and reinforce discriminatory attitudes about women’s roles in the workplace. Such behavior constitutes both gender and parental status discrimination.',\n",
       " 'Yes, this scenario is sexist. It relies on negative stereotypes about women, portraying them as inherently petty and untrustworthy, while elevating men as having superior, more genuine friendships. These broad generalizations unfairly judge an entire gender and ignore the complexity and diversity of human relationships. Such statements perpetuate gender bias and reinforce harmful societal norms.']"
